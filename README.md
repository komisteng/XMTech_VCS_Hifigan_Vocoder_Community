# XMTech_VCS_Hifigan_Vocoder_Community
A general purpose 48khz vocoder repository for mel spectrum converted vocals under development. It is similar to the Vocoder built into XMTech VCS Studio, but has different training data.

Supported for use in DiffSinger/Diffusion-SVC and other programs, the self-developed algorithm will have a higher reduction effect than NSF-Hifigan.
